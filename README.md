# Dardos Tech: Blog Application with Role-Based Access Control

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a simple blog application with role-based access control. The application supports two user roles: **Admin** and **User**. Admins can manage blog posts, while Users can view posts and add comments.

## Features

- **User Roles:**
  - **Admin:** Can add, edit, and delete blog posts.
  - **User:** Can view posts and add comments to any post.

- **Authentication:**
  - Implemented authentication to ensure only logged-in users can perform actions.

- **Post Management (Admin):**
  - Admins can add, edit, and delete blog posts. Each post includes a title, content, and timestamp.

- **Commenting (User):**
  - Logged-in users can comment on any post.
  - Comments are associated with both the user who posted them and the post they belong to.

- **User Interface:**
  - Simple and user-friendly UI using Blade templates.
  - Basic validation and error handling in controller.

- **Database:**
  - Managed using Eloquent ORM.
  - Database tables created via migrations.
  - Seeded with sample data for testing.
